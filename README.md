# homedirectory
My home directory automation

Regarding First Bootstrap
After install-pkgs, mount files form keybase MANUALLY

Notes in general
Will need to update pkgs from guake-gtk2-git to guake-git, once permissions error is solved. Re -> bmbaker comment on https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guake-git/
